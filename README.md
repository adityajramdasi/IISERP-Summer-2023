# Correlating Forbush Decrease Magnitudes and ICME properties
This public repository houses the data analysis work I did in analyzing Neutron Monitor time series data for my Summer 2023 research assistantship under Prof. Prasad Subramanian at IISER Pune. Includes the code I wrote, plots I generated, and statistical correlations I found between Forbush Decrease magnitudes and various ICME properties. The following is an overview of the context of this project, what I did, and my key learnings - 

## ICMEs and Space Weather -

The solar surface and atmosphere is a region of constant activity. The sun often ejects outbursts of plasma and magnetic fields from its corona, which are known as Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). Some of these ejections become big enough to escape the solar atmosphere and travel through interplanetary space. These are known as Interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs). A fraction of these ICMEs are directed towards the Earth, where they travel the Earth-Sun distance and collide with the Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere. This fills up energy in the Earth's magnetic field (like a stretched rubber band) by bending and stretching it, initiating a geomagnetic storm. A geomagnetic storm causes major disruptions in the near-Earth space weather, including exposing our satellites and astronauts to harmful radiation. Geomagnetic storms caused by ICMEs can disrupt all radio communication and overload electric power grids, causing widespread blackouts (see [Carrington event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrington_Event) for more). Thus, having an in-depth understanding of the dynamics of ICMEs and their effects on space weather is extremely crucial to protect our satellites, communication, and astronauts.
