# Correlating Forbush Decrease Magnitudes and ICME properties
This public repository houses the data analysis work I did in analyzing Neutron Monitor time series data for my Summer 2023 research assistantship under Prof. Prasad Subramanian at IISER Pune. Includes the code I wrote, plots I generated, and statistical correlations I found between Forbush Decrease magnitudes and various ICME properties. The following is an overview of the context of this project, what I did, and my key learnings -
